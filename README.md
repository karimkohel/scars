simply cars is a pipeline to fetch and process car image data for our private use in synapse

# requirements
the requirements would be separated depending on what you need to do with some general requirements that would be shared between them

# Plan

- in solitary steps
  - scrape from whatever scripts into the designated folders (solitary step)
- pipeline
  - after completing a car it should remove duplicates
  - crop and organize using yolo
  - filter using yolo

# more notes will follow once we get to know where are we headed.
- improve saving function to be more generic
- make every print into a log
- cleaner error handling
